# hermes
My version of Pi-hole using the official docker container from Pi-hole.net (https://github.com/pi-hole/docker-pi-hole/#running-pi-hole-docker)

Greatly inspired by https://github.com/pi-hole/docker-pi-hole/blob/master/docker_run.sh - with my own seasoning ;-)

And no! I haven't implemented docker-compose + .yml yet, but some day I might.
